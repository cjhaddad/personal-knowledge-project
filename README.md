# Personal Knowledge API - Project Proposal

## Project Summary
The Personal Knowledge API is a backend service that enables intelligent document management and question-answering through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users can upload documents (PDFs, text files, research papers) and interact with their content through natural language queries.

## Core Functionality:
- Document upload and storage
- Text extraction and intelligent chunking
- Vector-based semantic search using embeddings
- Natural language question answering with source attribution
- User management with authentication

## Technical Requirements Coverage
- **REST APIs**: CRUD operations with HTTP
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for user data and metadata, PineconeDB for vectors
- **Security**: JWT authentication, input validation, rate limiting, file restrictions
- **Scalability**: Redis caching, async processing, database optimization

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PineconeDB (vector storage)
- **Authentication**: JWT with secure token signing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with LangChain framework
- **Processing**: FastAPI Background Tasks for async document processing
